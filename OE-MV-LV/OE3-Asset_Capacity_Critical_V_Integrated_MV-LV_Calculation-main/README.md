# Assessment of Integrated MV-LV OE Calculations to Orchestrate DERs - OE Algorithm 3: Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage 
This repository is part of the project [Accelerating the Implementation of Operating Envelopes Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/accelerating-the-implementation-of-operating-envelopes-across-australia) funded by CSIRO. This project provided key metrics, recommendations, and guidance for distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) and AEMO (the Australian system operator) to assist them in improving and, hence, accelerating the use of Operating Envelopes (OEs) across Australia.

In this repository, we use interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python as well as a [realistic integrated medium voltage and low voltage (MV-LV) network](https://github.com/Team-Nando/MV-LV-Networks) to demonstrate the process and necessary calculations for the *Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE Algorithm with Integrated MV-LV Calculation* produced by The University of Melbourne. This demonstration is useful for different stakeholders (e.g., DNSPs, AEMO, CSIRO, regulators, consultancy companies, technology providers) as it can help them familiarise with the corresponding algorithm and the required inputs as well as the pros and cons.

## Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE with Integrated MV-LV Calculation
The Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE with Integrated MV-LV Calculations is an intermediate approach - it is more advanced than the Asset Capacity OE as both voltage and thermal aspects are considered, but less advanced than the Ideal OE - that is still relatively simple to be implemented since it does not need network models and only an extra monitoring (e.g., smart meter, temporary network meter) at the critical customer when compared to the Asset Capacity OE. In this OE approach, thermal issues are solved by estimating the spare capacity of MV and LV networks, while voltages issues are solved by estimating the voltage (using simple P-V sensitivity curves) at the critical customer of each LV network.
- Monitoring: At MV and LV head of feeders (P, Q, and V, all per phase), and at the critical customer of each LV network (net demand P, and voltage magnitude V).
- Electrical models: None.

## Pre-Requisites
- Python (Anaconda) and Jupyter Notebook (comes with Anaconda). For download links and more info: https://www.anaconda.com/download. Note that you must install the Anaconda that is compatible with your operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac). Also note that this repository is meant to be used by individuals (who can get free access to Anaconda).
- dss_python module. We use this Python-native module to run power flows based on OpenDSS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/). To install, run `pip install dss_python` in the Anaconda Prompt. For more info: https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-0-dss_python#part-0-using-dss_python.
- To guarantee that you have all the necessary packages you can also run the **`requirements.txt`** file using **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** in the Anaconda prompt.

## Run the Code
Make sure you have installed all the pre-requisites (Anaconda, dss_python, requirements). Otherwise, you will not be able to go through the repository.

1. Download all the files using the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right.
   - You will get a ZIP file with a folder that contains all the files.
   - Unzip the file and place the folder somewhere on your computer/laptop.
2. To open the Jupyter Notebook file (extension **`ipynb`**) you need to:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Click on Launch Jupyter Notebook (it will open in your browser)
   - Upload the unzipped folder (with all the corresponding files) to Jupyter Notebook (the location is up to you)
   - Go inside the folder and open the **`ipynb`** file

All the instructions will be in the **`ipynb`** file.
